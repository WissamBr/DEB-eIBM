# DEB-eIBM
This is a repository with the code for the paper "Environment-dependent population dynamics emerging from dynamic energy budgets and individual-scale movement behaviour" . It includes the source functions, example scripts and simulated data for the DEB-ÎµIBM: a spatially-explicit individual-based model for physiologically-structured population dynamics.
