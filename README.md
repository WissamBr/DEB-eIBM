# DEB-eIBM
This is a repository with the code for the paper "Environment-dependent population dynamics emerging from dynamic energy budgets and individual-scale movement behaviour". It includes the source functions, example scripts and simulated data for the DEB-ÎµIBM: a spatially-explicit individual-based model for physiologically-structured population dynamics.

The core functions of the model are found under "src/" and consist of the "Individual" datatype and the functions implementing the model processes. Under "scripts/", you can find an example script to run the model. And lastly, under "data/", you can find the raw simulated data shown in the paper.
